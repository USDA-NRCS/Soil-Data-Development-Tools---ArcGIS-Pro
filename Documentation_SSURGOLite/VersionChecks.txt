# Version checks are used to make sure that the SSURGO-TabularData being imported is compatible with the Database_Template.
# Some of these are actually hard-coded in the VBA, but except for perhaps all but the ExpectedImportDataModelVersion should come from the system table?
# Currently these version numbers are all focused on tabular data, but probably should be expanded to cover spatial version information as well.

# If I remove 6 columns from the templateDB.cointerp but left the SSURGO version the same, that would require a change in the ImportDataModel and would also be dependent on the SSURGOVersion.

Inputs:
    a. The version.txt files located in both tabular/spatial folders
    b. Database.system_templatedatabaseinformation table
    c. Varification code that was originally found in a VBA macro (Import Procedures.Verify_Version_Info)

Example of version.txt:  2.3.3


VBA variables: 
    1. VersionString (char)
    2. SSURGOVersion (int)
    3. ImportDataModelVersion (int)
    4. MetadataVersion (int)
    5. ExpectedSSURGOVersion (?)

VBA Constants:
    ExpectedSSURGOVersion = 2
    ExpectedImportDataModelVersion = 3
    BaseMetadataVersion = 1


Logic:
    a. version.txt file must exist. I believe this is only looking at tabular\version.txt
    b. Read first line in version.txt as VersionString
    c. VersionString must not be null and length must be >= 5
    d. Must be able to split VersionString into 3 parts using "." as the delimiter (SSURGOVersion, ImportDataModelVersion, MetadataVersion)
    e. Each part must be numeric
    f. Compare each version.txt value to the expected values. 
        1. 
        2. 
        3. MetadataVersion must be greater than BaseMetadataVersion
