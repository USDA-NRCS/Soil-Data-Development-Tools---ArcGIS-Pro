SSURGO data model changes
---------------------------------------------------------
mdstattabcols should include physicaldatatype column? Use MS Access datatypes for SSURGO and SQLite for SSURGO-lite?

mstattabs contains spatial tables and the mdstattabcols table has attribute columns listed,  

but does not list primary key or geometry column.

The spatial tables are not included in the metadata for relationships or indexes (neither attribute nor spatial).

Not sure if the spatial tables need to participate in constraints or triggers.

Consider adding indexes for cointerp.rulekey and cointerp.mrulekey

Mechanism for updating or editing these SSURGO-lite databases?

Potential problems with some keyword violations:
	month
	notnull
	precision
	some mixed-case table names
	spaces in MS Access tables ('SYSTEM *). Not sure if we plan to retain these tables.
	Some of the prepopulated SYSTEM tables are out-of-date.
